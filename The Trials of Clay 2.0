            Clayton has just finished basic html. This was a 2 hour affair.
            It was quite simple, but can he continue on? Next objective is
            CSS....my god will our hero survive? Can he continue down the road?

    <form>
            <label for="yes"><input id="yes" name="yes/no" type="checkbox">Yes</label>
            <label for="yes"><input id="no" name="yes/no" type="checkbox">No</label>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

        He's done it. Conquerer of the basic CSS trail. Unfortunately, Clayton
        has much to learn. CSS is a broad path and shall take many moons to master.
