    This is the <em>end of the road.</em> 
    How could we have hoped to accomplish this mission.
    Suicidal at best, psychotic at worst. The upper CSS 
    has been torment, the lower a disaster. We are barely into the basics.
    Yet for all of this, the companies pride shall not falter.
    Into the breach? Indeed we say.
